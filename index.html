                        <p class="card-text news">&nbsp; &nbsp;On the 25th of May, Memorial Day, the national holiday to honor and mourn American military martyrs, a devastatinglyroutine act of police brutality was captured on camera. Yet another cop murdered a Black man. <br><br>&nbsp;
                            &nbsp;George Floyd was pinned to to the ground by Minneapolis police and suffocated under the weight of the knee pressed against his neck. Some of GeorgeFloyd's last words echoed Eric Garner's dying plea for mercy, "I can't
                            breathe."

                        <p class="card-text news">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Brooks, 27, failed a sobriety test on 12 June after he was found asleep inside his car that was blocking a drive-through lane at a Wendy's restaurant. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;After pulling over his vehicle, the father-of-four
                            appeared "slightly impaired, but his behaviour during this incident was almost jovial", Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said on Wednesday.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;For over 40 minutes, video shows him complying with officers
                            as he consented to a weapons search and provided them with his identification details.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;However, as officers tried to handcuff him, he began struggling. The footage appears to show Mr Brooks punched Mr Rolfe,
                            grabbed Mr. Brosnan's stun gun and turned back while fleeing to fire it at Mr. Rolfe.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Brooks suffered two gunshots to the back that caused organ injuries and blood loss. One police bullet also hit a witness'
                            vehicle, nearly killing the driver, investigators say.

                <h2 class="card-title " style="text-align: center;">Sentiment
                </h2>
                <p class="card-text ">&nbsp;&nbsp;From these viewpoints and these news, let's talk about the robbery and destruction in the protest. I don't focus on the theft of large capital enterprise here, nor do I see the robbery from the perspective of 「White Man」or
                    a「Neutral」,(If people really want to reckon, how many Native Americans and blacks souls and lands white people robbed?) but to look at the whole incident from the perspective of the protest itself. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the
                    question lies in how we can explain the behavior of the protesters looting the small shops of ethnic minorities (such as Asians and Latinos). What's more, it also shows the protesters destroying the shelter of homelessness such as
                    "the underprivileged Groups harm the other Underprivileged Groups " situation.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Anarchism groups(such as "Antifa ") are to defeat any system of capital and authoritarianism, then why do they throw wolves to
                    the proletariat? Furthermore, is there an internal contradiction in this Anarchism Group? Do they put themselves in a privileged position and reproduce another class after closing the gap between some class systems?
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there was a black woman shouting at protesters loudly: "You are destroying the community here! You are destroying the people who live here! These people live in social houses and have to go by bus Work
                    every day, go to the hospital every day, and those homeless people, you are destroying the person like this! " So, the problem with these violent demonstrations is that these things constantly intensify internal conflicts. The social
                    system has to be changed, but the lives of more disadvantaged groups shouldn't be sacrificed at the same time.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many people think that protesters are not equal to violents, and believe that violents cannot
                    represent the position of the protesters, but I think these two are inseparable. There are always some of the protesters supporting the violent struggle. For example, in the Hong Kong anti-extradition, the valiant was throwing gasoline
                    bombs at the police and smashing the police office building. In the Taiwan Sunflower Movement, the hawks also forcibly occupied the Executive Yuan. Even in the February 28 incident, the protester organized militia Army against the
                    National Government. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it has been found that speculators have involved in a lot of violent incidents frequently. Not only the extremism group "Antifa " which is listed as a terrorist group by Trump but
                    3K party (Ku Klux Klan) also mingled into the riot. The truth that the media did not show to people was that white people also robbed and seized the store, blurring the movement of black people as the main body. Therefore, in addition
                    to resolving internal contradictions, but the protester also has to worry about intentional conflicts by speculators.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, I think this protest obey the preamble in the United States Declaration of Independence
                    which outlines a general philosophy of government that justifies revolution when government harms natural rights, like Frantz Fanon claimed when the colonists deal with the colonized through structural violence, the colonized must
                    relatively use the armed revolution to destroy the colonial regime to eliminate the problem of colonialism causing spiritual disorder to the people, however, he did not mention effects and sequelae bring from the violent revolution.
                    Thus, no matter what you are, the elephant or the jackass, people should focus on how to fix the problems among this kind of protest to avoid the situation being a vicious cycle.
