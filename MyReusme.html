        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I like to communicate with people and share new knowledge with them, I focus on the information about commercial and technology as well. Notwithstanding I'm a student of Foreign Language, I do not reject any opportunity to learn and
            I am willing to accept any challenge. Therefore, I have taken some courses in other departments such as "Foundations of Computer Science", "programming (Python)", "Internet marketing", "project management" and so on.</p>

                        to calm a person and make him/her feel comfortable if I want to persuade him/her.

                    <p class="text-justify p-3">&emsp;&emsp;As a student in the department of architecture design, I usually had to build architecture models which cost a large amount of money and time. In order to save my money and time, I have started to learn the concept of a
                        minimum viable product, how to use a little budget and time to practice my plan and design.

                    <p class="text-justify p-3">&emsp;&emsp;Because our colleges are distributed on three campuses, I have to rush to the college of management or technology school from the College of Liberal Arts when I finished the class in DFL, I usually have to ride my scooter
                        for a half-hour to arrive at another campus. I think this can show I am eager to learn new things. To fill the gap of knowledge between the student from those departments and me, I have started to learn how to acquire knowledge
                        on the internet as well.

                        group can send out their learning demand on the platform, then people can consider this demand to make a suitable course to help them without giving them the cramming education.
